##Final project

* This App

  RecipeShoppingApp is a single page app that supports searching and saving recipes. With saved recipes, the app will pull out the ingredients out of the recipes to make a shopping list.

* Why

  This is my final project completing Viking Code School Bootcamp. This is the client viewed side, made with React, Redux and Bootstrap that connected to the Rails backend, one directory up this project.
