        'Rinse the zucchini and pat dry. Trim off the ends and cut about a cupful of  zucchini into thin match sticks. Place in a saucepan, cover with cold water  and boil 3 to 4 minutes. Drain and set aside. Meanwhile cut the remaining  zucchini into small chunks and put in a kettle. Add the onion, peeled and  thinly sliced. Sprinkle with curry powder and stir to coat the pieces. Add  the chicken broth and bring to a boil, cover, and simmer about 15 minutes  or until zucchini is very tender. Whirl in a blender or food processor or  put through a food mill. There should be about 4 cups. Add the cream, milk,  salt and pepper to taste. Add the reserved zucchini stickls. Chill  thoroughly. Serve sprinkled with chopped chives. Serves 6 to 8.

    ingredients: [
      "1 tbls Olive Oil",
      "4 Duck Legs",
      "2 finely chopped Onions",
      "2 cloves minced Garlic",
      "2 tsp ground Cinnamon",
      "2 tsp Plain Flour",
      "250ml Red Wine",
      "800g Chopped Tomatoes",
      "1 Chicken Stock Cube",
      "3 sprigs Rosemary",
      "2 Bay Leaves",
      "1 tsp Sugar",
      "2 tbs Milk",
      "600g Paccheri Pasta",
      "Grated Parmesan Cheese"
    ],

    instructions:
      "Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the duck legs and brown on all sides for about 10 mins. Remove to a plate and set aside. Add the onions to the pan and cook for 5 mins until softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further 1 min, then stir in the cinnamon and flour and cook for a further min. Return the duck to the pan, add the wine, tomatoes, stock, herbs, sugar and seasoning. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat, cover with a lid and cook for 2 hrs, stirring every now and then. Carefully lift the duck legs out of the sauce and place on a plate â€“ they will be very tender so try not to lose any of the meat. Pull off and discard the fat, then shred the meat with 2 forks and discard the bones. Add the meat back to the sauce with the milk and simmer, uncovered, for a further 10-15 mins while you cook the pasta. Cook the pasta following pack instructions, then drain, reserving a cup of the pasta water, and add the pasta to the ragu. Stir to coat all the pasta in the sauce and cook for 1 min more, adding a splash of cooking liquid if it looks dry. Serve with grated Parmesan, if you like. "
