        the gammon in a very large pan with 2 litres water and bring to the boil.
        Remove from the heat and drain off the water \u2013 this helps to get rid
        of some of the saltiness. Recover with 2 litres cold water and bring to the
        boil again. Put everything but the frozen peas into the pan and bring to the
        boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 1\u00bd-2\u00bd hrs, topping up the
        water as and when you need to, to a similar level it started at. As the ham
        cooks and softens, you can halve it if you want, so it is all submerged under
        the liquid. When the ham is tender enough to pull into shreds, it is ready.\r\nLift
        out the ham, peel off and discard the skin. While it is still hot (wear a
        clean pair of rubber gloves), shred the meat. Remove bay from the soup and
        stir in the frozen peas. Simmer for 1 min, then blend until smooth. Add a
        splash of water if too thick, and return to the pan to heat through if it
        has cooled, or if you are making ahead.\r\nWhen you are ready to serve, mix
        the hot soup with most of the ham \u2013 gently reheat if made ahead. Serve
        in bowls with the remaining ham scattered on top, and eat with crusty bread
        and butter.","strMealThumb":"http:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/xxtsvx1511814083.jpg","strTags":"Soup,Warm","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qdhWz7qAaCU","strIngredient1":"Ham","strIngredient2":"Peas","strIngredient3":"Onions","strIngredient4":"Carrots","strIngredient5":"Bay
